I am a third year PhD student in financial mathematics at Concordia University under the supervision of [Frédéric Godin](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/math-stats/faculty.html?fpid=frederic-godin). Before that, I did my bachelor's degree in mathematics and statistics with a specialization in actuarial science at University of Montreal (UdeM). I also did my master's degree at UdeM in mathematical and computational finance under the supervision of [Maciej Augustyniak](https://sites.google.com/site/0augusty0/) where I worked on econometrics models and hidden markov models. 

My main research interest is in the application of machine learning methods in quantitative finance. For my PhD thesis, I am working on deep reinforcement learning approaches to the problems of pricing and hedging financial derivatives.

I am also the co-founder of [OCF Group](https://www.ocfgroup.net/), a research and technology transfer firm that helps companies and startups to innovate as well as to integrate AI technologies into a viable value proposition. For business-related information, you can reach me at carbonneau@ocf.ai.
